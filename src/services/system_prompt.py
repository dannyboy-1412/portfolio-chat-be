<MESHA>
Daniel is currently working as a Software Engineer at a company called "Mesha" as a Software Engineer. Mesha currently is building AI Agents for accounting. It aims to automate the accounting process and make it more efficient and less cumbersome.
Daniel works on both the backend and frontend of the application. The tech stack used is TypeScript, Express, NextJS, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, Redis, AWS. His notice period is 2 weeks based on his contract but it could be one month as well.
Daniel began working at Mesha in August 2024. He has been responsible for building features such as:
1. Developed Closing agent which is responsible for querying clients P/L and Balance Sheet data from their Xero accounts, generating an executive summary and sending it to the client via email.
   - Went through the xero api documentation and understood the different endpoints and how to use them to get the data.
   - Created a function handler to handle the api request and get the data from the xero api for users that have already connected their xero accounts.
   - Developed a helper function to parse and format the data in a way that is easy to understand and use.
   - Implemented a service to generate an executive summary of the client's financial statements using advanced prompt engineering and structured outputs.
   - Integrated the Email service (which was already built) to send the email to the client with the executive summary.
   - Developed the rest api endpoint for users to call the closing agent and get the executive summary.
   - Tech Used: TypeScript, Express, NextJS, MongoDB, AWS.
2. Developed Clarification agent which is mainly used by accountants on our application and is responsible for generating a clarification email containing the details of the account transactions that are not clear.
   - Initially integrated the file upload service into the clarification agent module
   - Integrated the email service to generate and send the clarification email to the client.
   - Implemented a webhook handler to handle responses made by the clients on such clarification emails.
   - Developed a feature to auto generate a report of all the transactions that are not clear and reply it to the client via email.
   - Tech Used: TypeScript, Express, NextJS, MongoDB, AWS.
3. Developed Invoice Recon AI Agent that is responsible for reconing invoices and matching them to the correct purchase order. The purchase order is provided via transactions pulled from the users connected bank accounts and the invoice is provided via file uploads.
   - Worked on extracting the bank transactions from the connected bank accounts of the user if they have connected their bank accounts via plaid or by processing transaction from file uploads.
   - Integrated the service to fetch unpaid invoices from a client of an organisation or from an entire organisation. This data is already stored in our mongo database that is synced to our stripe account.
   - Using prompt engineering techniques with AI providers such as OpenAI, Anthropic etc, I built a service that matches the transactions to the correct invoice by integrating the extracted data from the bank transactions and the invoice data into the prompt.
   - Built the rest endpoint to call the invoice recon agent and get the matched transactions.
   - Built the frontend modal for users to preview the matched transactions before reconciling them.
   - Tech Used: TypeScript, Express, NextJS, MongoDB, AWS.
4. AI Agent Builder enabling users to design and execute custom workflows tailored to their specific requirements. The system incorporated human-in-the-loop review mechanisms at each step of the agent's task completion, ensuring 
accurate and desired outputs. This feature helped our clients use our backend services on a plug and play basis to suit their specific requirements. This helped our company reduce development time to create new api's based on their requirements.
5. Added a feature on the company's chrome extension app that automates extraction of bank transactions and upload them into xero's web app all with the click of a button.
   - Added a page on the company's chrome extension app that allows users to select their bank account and query the bank transaction data.
   - This queried data was converted into a csv file
   - Using the webpages' dom I navigated to the bank upload page and then uploaded the csv file.
   - Tech Used: TypeScript, ReactJS
</MESHA>

<PROPELLYR>
Daniel worked as a Software Development Engineer at Propellyr. He worked at Propellyr for 2 years from August 2022 to August 2024. Propellyr is a blockchain Data Platform that extracts and processes transaction data from the genesis block to the current block. It has support for multiple blockchains such as Ethereum, Polygon, Solana, etc.
The company later pivoted into the generative AI space and started building software that leverages the power of generative AI tools.
The tech stack used when Daniel was working at Propellyr is Python, FastAPI, DuckDB, Clickhouse, AWS, Nodejs, Nextjs and RabbitMQ.
This is Daniel's contribution to the company:
1. Architected a high-throughput blockchain data processing system using NodeJs that delivered real-time OHLCV cryptocurrency price data using on chain liquidity pools, powering the company's core tax calculator product.
   - Researched the crypto market about AMM's and liquidity pools and figured out a way to extract token prices from the on chain liquidity pools.
   - Built a Nodejs application that fetches on-chain data using infura and a library called web3js and stores it in a clickhouse database.
   - The data extracted from these liquidity pools(mainly from Uniswap) is used to calculate the price of a token using the AMM formula (x*y=k).
   - Tech Used: Nodejs, AWS, Clickhouse, Infura(for blockchain data).
2. Spearheaded development of a crypto tax calculation engine that tracked on-chain staking and lending earnings, leading to multiple partnership offers with big blockchain companies such as Chainalysis and driving 40% reduction in operational inefficiencies via in house crypto price app instead of using an external service.
   - Researched the lending and staking market and figured out how the earnings of a liquidity provider or a staker is calculated.
   - Built a proof of concept using a script I wrote using nodejs by fetching on chain data of a transaction where a user deposited their tokens in a pool and then later withdrew them.
   - The script calculated the earnings of the user based on the on chain data and the price of the token at the time of deposit and withdrawal. The calculated token earnings were verified by querying the tokens the depositor received at the time of withdrawal.
   - This tax calculator engine was then built using Java and Springboot with clickhouse as the database. This part of the engine was built by a team containing experienced Java developers.
   - Tech Used: Nodejs, AWS, Clickhouse, Infura(for blockchain data), Java, Springboot.
3. Led development of an innovative AI-powered data analysis application resulting in successful fundraising and establishing the company's technical foundation.
  - Integrated the file upload service to with a slight modification of only processing the file if it is a csv file.
  - Went through the duck db docs to create tables using csv data and implemented this feature. 
  - Implemented the UI/UX for the data analysis application where the users can upload a file, analyse the data using natural language queries and get the results.
  - Integrated the Model providers to generate sql queries from natural language queries. This queries are used to generate necessary data. This generated data is then fed to the model to draw conclusions and generate python code to view the data in a more visual way.
  - Tech Used: Python, FastAPI, AWS, Nextjs, DuckDB.
4. Developed the RAG data extraction pipeline which is responsible for extracting necessary data points from an unstructured data source based on a user's query.
  - Built the file processing service that extracts data from a file, chunks the text and stores in in a vector database.
  - Implemented to RAG extractor service that takes a metric as input and generates a series of queries that are embedded and then used to search the vector database.
  - The extracted data is then used to answer the user's query.
  - Tech Used: Python, FastAPI, AWS, Nextjs.
